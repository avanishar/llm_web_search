Today we’re introducing
Flow
, our new AI filmmaking tool.
It’s built by and for creatives, and it’s the only AI filmmaking tool custom-designed for Google’s most advanced models — Veo, Imagen and Gemini. Flow can help storytellers explore their ideas without bounds and create cinematic clips and scenes for their stories. It’s early days, and we’re excited to shape the future of Flow with creatives and filmmakers.
What’s possible with Flow
Flow is inspired by what it feels like when time slows down and creation is effortless, iterative and full of possibility. It’s custom-designed for Veo, Google’s state-of-the-art generative video model, with exceptional prompt adherence and stunning cinematic outputs that excel at physics and realism. Behind the scenes, Gemini models make prompting intuitive, so you can describe your vision in everyday language. You can bring your own assets to create characters, or use Flow to make your own ingredients with Imagen’s text-to-image capabilities.
Once you’ve created a subject or a scene, you can integrate those same ingredients into different clips and scenes with consistency. Or you can use a scene image to start a new shot.

Get started with Flow
Flow is the evolution of VideoFX, a Google Labs experiment that launched last year. Starting today, Flow is available to subscribers of our Google AI Pro and Google AI Ultra plans in the U.S., with more countries coming soon.
Google AI Pro gives you the key Flow features and 100 generations per month, and
Google AI Ultra
gives you the highest usage limits and early access to Veo 3 with native audio generation, bringing environmental sounds and character dialogue directly into video creation.
How we’re collaborating with filmmakers
As with any groundbreaking technology, we’re still understanding the full potential of AI in filmmaking. We see the emergence of these tools as an enabler, helping a new wave of filmmakers more easily tell their stories. By offering filmmakers early access to Flow, we were able to better understand how our technology could best support and integrate into their creative workflows — and we’ve woven their insights into Flow. Here are some filmmakers we partnered with and the short films they developed using Flow along with other tools and techniques.
Dave Clark
Dave is an award-winning filmmaker focused on embracing new technology as part of his filmmaking. He used AI to develop two of his most recent short films, “
Battalion
” and “
NinjaPunk
.” His newest short film “Freelancers” uses Google’s AI and other tools to tell the story of two estranged adopted brothers on similar quests.
Henry Daubrez
Henry has been using tech tools in his art for the last 18 years. Earlier this year he unveiled “
Kitsune
” using Veo 2 — a moving short film about “love between two souls separated by everything except their shared feelings of loneliness.” Now, Henry is bringing the story of his own creative journey to life in “Electric Pink.”
Junie Lau
Junie Lau is a film director and multidisciplinary creative deeply passionate about innovation, viewing AI as a vital collaborator in expanding the boundaries of creative expression. Her work delves into artistic narratives within the hyper-modern era, including themes of virtual identity, digital humanities and digital ontology. Currently, Junie is working on a film titled “Dear Stranger,” which explores the boundless and infinite nature of universal love between a grandmother and grandchild across countless parallel worlds.
AI is ushering in a new chapter of creativity and filmmaking, and while it’s still early, we see so much potential for tools like Flow to unlock new voices and creations.
