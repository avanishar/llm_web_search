Gemini
We’re thrilled by the response to
Veo 3
. The
Google AI Ultra plan
grants the highest access to Veo 3 and later today we’re launching it in the UK. The Ultra plan is now available in
73 countries
, and we’re working hard to bring it to even more.
Google AI Pro subscribers in those countries get limited access to Veo 3 in
Flow
, and a 10-pack of trial video generations to test it out in the
Gemini app
. Starting today, Pro subscribers will also have access to Veo 3 in the Gemini mobile app.
It's important that people can access provenance tools for content online. The SynthID watermark is embedded in all content generated by Google's generative AI models. Our
SynthID Detector
rolled out to early testers last week, and we plan to expand access soon. As an additional step to help people identify AI-generated content, today we're adding a visible watermark to all videos, except for videos generated by Ultra members in Flow, our tool for AI filmmakers.
