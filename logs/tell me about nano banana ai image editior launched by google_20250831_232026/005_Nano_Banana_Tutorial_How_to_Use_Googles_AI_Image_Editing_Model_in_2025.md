A step-by-step guide to editing, blending, and enhancing images with Nano Banana in Google Gemini and Imogen.
People on the Internet are going bananas over Nano Banana, a new image editing model from Google’s DeepMind.
This is currently the
top-rated image editing model in the world
. And just a few hours ago,
Nano Banana was integrated into Google’s Gemini
and into
my favorite image-editing app, Imogen
.
Now you have more control than ever to create the perfect image you’ve always imagined.
The use cases are endless. You can use it for:
Product photography
Fashion photography
Social media images
And much more
All it takes is your creativity and the perfect prompt.
In this article, I’m super excited to share a detailed walkthrough of how to use Nano Banana with two apps —
Google’s Gemini, and
Imogen
The best part is, you can use this for free.

Takeaway: Is Nano Banana Worth the Hype?
How to use Nano Banana
You can use Nano Banana on Google Gemini. But all edited images have a watermark.
Alternatively, you can download the app
Imogen
from App Store.
Imogen
is a freemium iOS/macOS app with a sharp, intuitive interface built for creators and social storytellers. Now that Nano Banana is under the hood,
Imogen
delivers the kind of hyperrealistic edits and background swaps we’re all going bananas over, just with one tap. It’s like having Google’s top-tier image editing model in your pocket, without needing Gemini.
Editing with Nano Banana on Imogen
Editing an image using Nano Banana on
Imogen
is simple. Just upload your image and type in the prompt. For example, I used this image and wrote the prompt,
“Make her wear a sari standing in a field.”

app (Screenshot by the author).
And in a few seconds, this is the result I got —

Imogen
app.
If you just want to experiment with image editing on Nano Banana, the free version of
Imogen
provides some photos free daily. But if you want unlimited usage, the
Imogen
pro lets you explore your creativity without any limits.
Editing with Nano Banana on Google Gemini
Just sign into Gemini with your Google account. Upload an image, write a prompt, and your image will be ready in a few seconds.

Before we dive in, here are a few cool use cases of Nano Banana:
Change your costume or location in any picture you upload.
Blend two photos together.
Multi-turn editing: This means you first upload an image, make some edits, and then you can make more edits on the updated image. The AI remembers your previous commands, giving it context and making it more powerful than ever.
Example 1: Transforming a selfie
I used an image that I clicked a few days back, sitting in my car with my seatbelt on. Using Nano Banana, I created this image:

Here’s the prompt I used:
“Make me look like a princess in the Ramayana, holding flowers.”
Let’s take a closer look:
My face still looks like it does in real life.
The picture has a little Ramayana-inspired styling, with deep center parting, a saree, and flowers, giving Indian princess vibes from the medieval era.
I would say Nano Banana has done a great job here.
Example 2: Blending two photos
I wanted to blend two photos together. I used the same selfie as before and a photo of my dog, Lucy.
The prompt was:
“Make this woman pet this dog and create a picture of them together”.
The result looks super natural. My carpet is intact, a couch is in the background, and it looks like it was clicked in my living room. If I told you this was real, you’d 100% believe it. I love the realism in this image.

Example 3: Virtual try-on
Another cool use case is virtual try-on. You can upload a picture of yourself and a dress which you’d like to purchase from an e-commerce site. You can ask Nano Banana to combine them to make it appear as if you’re wearing the dress. Here’s my experience:
First result:
The dress appeared on top of my regular clothes. Not ideal. The first prompt:
“Make this woman wear this black dress.”
Second result: The top was correct, but the pants remained.
“Can you make her wear the dress after removing everything else she is wearing?”
Third result: The pants were removed, showing how the dress looks fully on me. The final prompt was, “
Can you remove the pants so that her legs are visible?”
Image generated by Nano Banana (Before vs. After)
Limitation: After multiple rounds of editing, my face looked slightly distorted. The image quality was also compromised, and the final result looks pixellated.
Images generated by Nano Banana in Google Gemini: First round (Left), second round (Center) and final round (Right).
Example 4: AI Interior design with Nano Banana
Step 1:
Upload an image. I selected a blank living room image from the internet.
Step 2:
Add a bookshelf. I prompted Nano Banana to add a floor-to-ceiling bookshelf on the blank wall.
The AI generated a high-quality image, even on the free plan. You don’t need to buy the pro plan of Gemini to generate these images.
Step 3:
Add a couch. I uploaded an image of a sofa and prompted:
“Add this sofa in the room where it fits best.”
The result is a beautifully arranged room. Nano Banana gives a lot of creative liberty, and the output is impressive.
This is just an example. The rest depends on how well you can prompt the AI to generate amazing results.
Other use cases of Nano Banana
Colorizing and enhancing photos
Interior design
Product photography
E-commerce visuals
And more
Limitations of Nano Banana
Even though Nano Banana is super powerful, when removing clothes, sometimes the old clothes are not removed properly.
If you’re editing a person’s face across multiple turns, a few distortions might occur, like what happened when I tried the virtual try-on feature.
After multiple edit turns, the image quality is also degraded, as you can see the images where I used the try on feature.
If you use Nano Banana on Gemini, all the edited images will have a Gemini logo as a watermark on bottom right. However, if you edit the images on
Imogen
, there’s no watermark.
How to upscale images after multi-turn editing on Nano Banana
Let’s take a look at the step-by-step process.
Step 1:
Upload your image
Imogen
and write the prompt. For this illustration, I used the prompt
“Make her wear a black jacket.”
Screenshot by the author of
Imogen
workspace.
I got a result of a nice image where I’m wearing a black jacket, my face isn’t altered, and there’s no watermark either!

Imogen

However, as you can see, the image looks a bit blurred. Let’s try to upscale it using
Imogen
.
Step 2:
You can simply select the edited image on
Imogen
and write the prompt,
“Upscale this image.”
Within a few seconds, you’ll get the upscaled image. Here are the results using
Imogen
—

The quality is so crisp, I’m in awe. And the black jacket looks natural, like I actually wore it. Honestly, AI is awesome. :)
Takeaway: Is Nano Banana Worth the Hype?
That said, Nano Banana is an amazing image editing model. I can’t wait for you to try this tool. Can definitely be called the top-rated image editing model in the world.
