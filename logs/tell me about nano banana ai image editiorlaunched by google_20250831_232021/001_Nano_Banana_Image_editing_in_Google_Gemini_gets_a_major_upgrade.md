Today in the
Gemini app
, we're unveiling a new image editing model from Google DeepMind. People have been going
bananas
over it already in early previews — it's the
top-rated
image editing model in the world. Now, we're excited to share that it's integrated into the Gemini app so you have more control than ever to create the perfect picture.
Maintain your look as you edit
We launched native image editing
in the Gemini app earlier this year, and we’ve been working hard to improve it, with particular focus on maintaining a character's likeness from one image to the next. We know that when editing pictures of yourself or people you know well, subtle flaws matter — a depiction that’s "close but not quite the same" doesn’t feel right. That's why our latest update is designed to make photos of your friends, family and even your pets look consistently like themselves, whether you're trying out a 60’s beehive haircut or putting a tutu on your chihuahua.
Just give Gemini a photo to work with, and tell it what you'd like to change to add your unique touch. Gemini lets you combine photos to put yourself in a picture with your pet, change the background of a room to preview new wallpaper or place yourself anywhere in the world you can imagine — all while keeping you, you. Once you're done, you can even upload your edited image back into Gemini to turn your new photo into a fun video.
Bring your vision to life with advanced editing
Here are a few things to try as you explore this new image editing capability:
Give yourself a costume or location change
: Upload a photo of a person or pet, and our model will keep their look the same in every image as you place them in new scenarios. Try putting yourself in different outfits or professions, or even see how you’d appear in another decade — all while still looking like you.
Blend photos together
: You can now upload multiple photos and blend them together for a brand-new scene. For example, take your photo and another of your dog to create a perfect portrait of you both on the basketball court.
Try multi-turn editing
: You can keep editing the images Gemini makes — take an empty room, paint the walls, then add a bookshelf, some furniture or a coffee table. Gemini's working with you all along to alter specific parts of an image while preserving the rest.
Mix up designs
: Apply the style of one image to an object in another. You can take the color and texture of flower petals and apply it to a pair of rainboots, or design a dress using the pattern from a butterfly's wings.
You can try this updated image editing capability in the Gemini app starting today. All images created or edited in the Gemini app include a visible watermark, as well as our invisible SynthID digital watermark, to clearly show they are AI-generated.
