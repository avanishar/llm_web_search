Google has a knack for assigning strange names to its products.
Its original LLM was named Bard — a thinly-veiled Shakespeare reference that was quickly dropped in favor of the techier-sounding Gemini.
AI Overviews — an industry-shaking technology — was originally the clunky Search Generative Experience. And don’t even get me started about
EEAT.
Google’s newest AI image generator, though, takes the cake. It’s named
Nano Banana
— a moniker that Google is already apparently walking back, as
all references to the original name have been scrubbed from the release notes.
With such a bizarre name, at least Nano Banana has a saving grace — it’s insanely good.
Specifically, Nano Banana excels at
editing
existing images, rather than simply summoning new ones out of the AI ether.
I put the new model through its paces and tested its insane image editing capabilities.
