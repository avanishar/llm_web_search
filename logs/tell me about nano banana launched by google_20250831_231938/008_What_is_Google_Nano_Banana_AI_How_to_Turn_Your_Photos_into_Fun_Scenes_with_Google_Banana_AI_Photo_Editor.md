Google has launched Nano Banana, a powerful generative image editing model available in the Gemini app. It allows multi-turn editing and photo blending while consistently preserving the appearance of people and pets. This new tool, with its state-of-the-art AI and built-in watermarking, makes creative and complex photo editing accessible to all users.
Nano Banana is the latest generative image editing model by Google, unveiled recently as a live project within the Gemini app on both Android and iOS devices as well as through web-based browsers.
It allows its users to add photos and make a superb number of editing, various background changes, effects of cartoon displays, addition of two or more photos on top of others, etc., without having lost the original shapes and features of people.
What is so astounding is the fact that judging anonymously, the application was rated as being among the most comprehensive image editors on the planet even before it had officially been announced.
Features and Capabilities: Nano Banana AI
Appearance Maintenance:
Nano Banana can do a lot of unusual manipulations with different outfits, hair styles, cartoon figures, or fantasy backgrounds, but keeps faces, pets, and other important items the same in multiple edits.
Photo Blending and Scene Creation:
There are a variety of images which one can combine, including putting a person and his/her pet in a different location, and combining objects to come up with funny scenes.
Multi-Turn Editing
Make step-by-step adjustments like redecorating a room, the use of new furniture, and subsequently inserting yourself into the picture--with the AI preserving the illustration level and similarity.
Design Blending:
Stimulate the imagination by stealing texture or designs (like flower petals or butterfly wings) in one photo and plastering it on another.
Watermarking & Accountability:
Every AI-generated image from Nano Banana bears a visible watermark and Google‚Äôs SynthID invisible digital mark, ensuring transparency and authenticity.

Why Is It Different?
Unlike the vast majority of AI editors that distort faces, or wash out important information with each change, Nano Banana incorporates the underlying model of Google DeepMind where successive edits can be made to the character keeping them consistent.
The resultant designs look playful, inventive and yet always you- even with most preposterously designed situations. The combination of state-of-the-art AI with privacy and deep watermarks make Google a powerful rival in the future of online content generating business.

Accessibility and Access by the Developer
Nano Banana will support all Gemini app worldwide and pro and free accounts. Software developers and companies can incorporate the model into their processes and applications using the Gemini API, Google AI Studio and Google Cloud Vertex AI. The API would cost $30 per 1 million output tokens, and under typical use, each image edit would cost about 0.039.
