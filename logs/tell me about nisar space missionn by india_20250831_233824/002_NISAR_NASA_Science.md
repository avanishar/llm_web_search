Behind the Science
Designed to provide a detailed view of the Earth to observe and measure some of the planet's most complex processes, including ecosystem disturbances, ice-sheet collapse, natural hazards, sea level rise, and groundwater issues. Its radar, the first of its kind in space, will systematically map Earth, measuring changes of our planet's surface as small as a centimeter.
Type
Orbiter
Launch
2025
Partners
NASA, Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO)

747 km/98.4°
Mission Overview
An Unprecedented View of Earth
NISAR's data can help people worldwide better manage natural resources and hazards, as well as providing information for scientists to better understand the effects and pace of climate change. It will also add to our understanding of our planet's hard outer layer, called its crust.

The Magic of SAR
NISAR will be the first radar of its kind in space to systematically map Earth, using two different radar frequencies (L-band and S-band) to measure changes of our planet’s surface, including movements as small as centimeter. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) refers to a technique for producing fine-resolution images from a resolution-limited radar system.
