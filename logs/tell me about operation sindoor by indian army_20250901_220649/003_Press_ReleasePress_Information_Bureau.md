Operation SINDOOR: Forging One Force
The Synergy of India’s Armed Forces
Posted On:
                18 MAY 2025 5:42PM by PIB Delhi
Introduction
In an age of multi-domain warfare, where threats evolve faster than borders shift,
India's national security architecture has demonstrated the strength of jointness and strategic foresight
.
Operation SINDOOR
, initiated on
May 7, 2025
, in the aftermath of the
Pahalgam terror attack
, which claimed the lives of 26 innocent civilians
showcased a calibrated,
tri-services response
that embodied precision, professionalism, and purpose.
Operation SINDOOR was conceived as a punitive and targeted campaign to
dismantle the terror infrastructure
across the
Line of Control
and deeper inside Pakistan.
Multi-agency intelligence
provided confirmation of
nine
major camps that were eventually targeted in the operation. India’s retaliatory action was based on
meticulous planning
and an
intelligence-led approach
, which ensured that the operations were conducted with
minimal collateral damage
. Operational ethics were central to the mission, and restraint was exercised to avoid civilian harm.
In the aftermath of Operation SINDOOR
, Pakistan initiated a series of
retaliatory drone and UCAV attacks
targeting key
Indian airbases
and
logistics infrastructure
. These attempts, however, were effectively neutralised by India’s
comprehensive and multilayered air defence architecture
. Central to this success was the
Integrated Command and Control Strategy (ICCS)
, which facilitated
real-time threat identification, assessment, and interception
across multiple domains.
In every single domain of Operation Sindoor there was operational
synergy
between the forces and fully supported by the Government, agencies and departments.
The operation unfolded across land, air, and sea—
a seamless demonstration of synergy
between the
Indian Army, Air Force, and Navy
. The Indian Air Force (IAF) played a crucial role in delivering precision strikes against terror infrastructure across Pakistan. It conducted
high-impact air operations
on targets such as the
Nur Khan Air Base
and the
Rahimyar Khan Air Base
, with visual evidence of damage presented during official briefings. The Air Force's robust air defence environment proved pivotal in protecting Indian airspace during retaliatory drone and UAV attacks from across the border. The indigenously developed
Akash
surface-to-air missile system
and legacy platforms like the
Pechora
and
OSA-AK
were deployed effectively in a layered defence grid. The IAF’s Integrated Air Command and Control System
enabled
real-time coordination
of air assets, allowing Indian forces to neutralize aerial threats efficiently and maintain net-centric operations throughout the conflict.
Simultaneously
, the Indian Army demonstrated its preparedness and effectiveness in both defensive and offensive roles. The Army's air defence units worked in tandem with the Air Force, deploying a wide array of systems ranging from
shoulder-fired MANPADS
and
LLAD guns
to
long-range SAMs
. These units were instrumental in countering waves of drones and loitering munitions launched by Pakistan. Despite Pakistan’s unrelenting efforts to inflict damage, Indian forces succeeded in ensuring the security of both military and civilian infrastructure.
The Indian Navy played a critical role in asserting maritime dominance during Operation SINDOOR. Operating as a composite networked force, the Navy deployed its
Carrier Battle Group (CBG)
equipped with
MiG-29K fighter jets
and
airborne early warning helicopters
. This ensured persistent surveillance and real-time identification of threats across the maritime domain. The CBG maintained a
powerful air defence shield
that prevented hostile aerial incursions, especially from the
Makran coast
. The Navy's presence created a strong deterrent and effectively bottled-up Pakistani air elements along their western seaboard, denying them any operational space. Naval pilots conducted round-the-clock sorties, further demonstrating India’s readiness and strategic reach in the region. The Navy’s ability to establish uncontested control over the seas also validated its anti-missile and anti-aircraft defence capabilities in a complex threat environment.
During Operation Sindoor, the
Border Security Force (BSF)
also played a critical role in thwarting a
major infiltration attempt
along the International Border in the
Samba
district of Jammu and Kashmir. BSF troops noticed suspicious movement in the early hours and swiftly responded, leading to a heavy exchange of fire. In the ensuing encounter, the BSF
successfully neutralized
at least
two infiltrators and recovered arms, ammunition, and other war-like stores
. The operation underscored the BSF’s vigilance, operational preparedness, and its crucial role in maintaining border security during heightened tensions.
Operation SINDOOR was thus not just a tactical success but a
strategic statement
. It demonstrated India’s capacity for
high-precision, coordinated military action across land, air, and sea.
The operation was made possible by years of investment in defence preparedness and the unwavering policy and budgetary support from the Government of India. The message was clear: when appeals to reason and diplomacy are met with continued aggression, a decisive response is both justified and necessary. In sum, Operation SINDOOR will be remembered as a
defining moment in India’s defence history—a symbol of military precision, inter-service cooperation, and national resolve.
It successfully eliminated terror threats, reaffirmed India’s regional dominance, and sent a strong message that cross-border terrorism would be met with a calibrated yet firm response.
Major Government-Led Coordination Efforts Among the Armed Forces
1. Creation of the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS)
On
24 December 2019
, the Union Cabinet approved the creation of the
Chief of Defence Staff (CDS)
, a four-star General who heads the
Department of Military Affairs (DMA)
and acts as the principal military adviser to the Defence Minister on tri-Service matters.
Key roles of the CDS include:
Overseeing the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Territorial Army.
Promoting jointness in procurement, training, staffing, and command restructuring.
Leading tri-service organizations, including cyber and space commands.
Advising the Nuclear Command Authority and participating in defence planning bodies.
Driving reforms to optimize resources, enhance combat capabilities, and reduce waste.
Implementing multi-year defence acquisition plans and prioritizing inter-Service needs.
The CDS strengthens unified leadership and fosters integration for a more coordinated and modern Indian military.
2. Integrated Theatre Commands
(ITCs)
To modernize the Armed Forces, efforts are underway to restructure forces through the establishment of
Integrated Theatre Commands (ITCs)
and
Integrated Battle Groups (IBGs)
. These reforms aim to optimize operational preparedness by unifying the Army, Navy, and Air Force capabilities based on geography and function. Studies at the Service Headquarters level are actively exploring Theatre Commands for
Land Borders, Maritime, and Joint/Integrated Air Defence
to enhance synergy and combat effectiveness. The Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Gen Anil Chauhan has emphasized that
jointness and integration
are essential prerequisites for ITCs, which will clearly separate operational roles from administrative Raise-Train-Sustain (RTS) functions, allowing commanders to focus on security and operations. ITCs represent the start of wider reforms toward
multi-domain operations
, integrating space and cyberspace with traditional domains, and advancing digitization and data-centric warfare.
3. Creation of the Department of Military Affairs (DMA)
Department of Military Affairs (DMA)
with
CDS
as
Secretary
was created in
2020
to facilitate optimal utilization of resources and
promote jointness
among the three Services. The subjects allocated to DMA include:
The
Armed Forces
of the Union, namely, Army, Navy and Air Force.
Integrated Headquarters of the Ministry of Defence
comprising of Army Headquarters, Naval Headquarters, Air Headquarters and Defence Staff Headquarters.
Works relating to Army, Navy and Air Force
.
Promoting jointness in procurement
, training and staffing for the Services through joint planning and integration of their requirements.
Facilitation of restructuring of Military Commands
for optimal utilisation of resources by bringing about jointness in operations, including through establishment of joint / theatre commands.
4. Inter-Services Organisations (Command, Control & Discipline) Act, 2023
The Inter-Services Organisations (Command, Control & Discipline) Act, 2023 promotes
jointness
in the Indian Armed Forces by
empowering commanders
of
tri-service formations with authority over personnel from all three Services.
This unifies the disciplinary chain, speeds up decision-making, and fosters operational and cultural integration. By streamlining command without affecting individual Service identities, the Act lays the legal foundation for future integrated theatre commands. Key implications of this Act are:
Unified command:
ISO commanders can discipline all personnel under one authority.
Faster processes:
Reduces delays from inter-Service coordination.
Joint culture:
Encourages cross-Service cohesion and shared responsibility.
Legal base for theatre commands:
Supports future integrated operations.
Service identity retained:
Each Service’s unique norms remain intact.
5. Joint Logistics Nodes (JLNs)
Three Joint Logistic Nodes (JLNs)
have been established and are operational since
2021
at
Mumbai
,
Guwahati
and
Port Blair
for
Logistics Integration
between the
three services
. These JLNs will provide
integrated logistics cover
to the Armed Forces for their small arms ammunition, rations, fuel, general stores, civil hired transport, aviation clothing, spares and also engineering support in an effort to synergize their operational efforts. This initiative would accrue advantages in terms of
saving of manpower, economize utilisation of resources, besides financial savings.
6. Joint Training Courses, Seminars & Exercises

Marine Commandos
from the Indian Navy along with the
Garud (Special Forces)
from the Indian Air Force, participating together in a simulated combat environment. This high-intensity drill was aimed at enhancing
interoperability, coordination
and
synergy
among the three Special Forces units to ensure
swift
and
effective response
towards emerging security challenges.
7. Technology Integration & Network-Centric Warfare
Defence Communication Network (DCN):
The DCN is a
strategic
,
exclusive
,
secure
and
state-of-the-art communication network
. Implementation of DCN is a proof of strength of the Indian industry and has reaffirmed the emphasis of the Government on
Make in India
program. The DCN is a major step towards ensuring
Network Centricity
across the three Services
, Integrated Defence Staff and Strategic Forces Command. The network provides converged voice, data and video services to the three Services based on secured system with adequate redundancy.
Integrated Air Command and Control System (IACCS):
The Integrated Air Command and Control System (IACCS) of the Indian Air Force provides the backbone for real-time coordination, enabling synchronized responses across multiple units of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. This system proved its mettle recently during the tensions between India and Pakistan post Operation SINDOOR.
8. ‘Year of Defence Reforms’ – 2025
Defence Minister
Shri Rajnath Singh
, with all the
Secretaries of the Ministry of Defence
unanimously decided to observe 2025 as the
‘Year of Reforms’
in the MoD. This would aim at
transforming the Armed Forces into a technologically-advanced combat-ready force capable of multi-domain integrated operations
. The broad areas identified for focussed intervention in 2025 include:
Reforms should aim to further
bolster Jointness & Integration initiatives
and facilitate establishment of the
Integrated Theatre Commands
.
Develop a shared understanding of operational requirements and joint operational capabilities through
inter-service cooperation & training
.
Conclusion
India’s ability to project strength across
land, sea, and air
is no longer theoretical—it is structured, synchronized, and deeply integrated. The nation’s
tri-services architecture
now operates as a cohesive force. As modern threats blur traditional boundaries, this integrated posture ensures that whether confronting aggression on the high Himalayas, securing maritime frontiers, or neutralizing aerial intrusions, India stands
ready, resilient, and united
. The future of national security lies in jointness—and India is already charting that future with purpose and resolve.

Operation SINDOOR: Forging One Force
The Synergy of India’s Armed Forces
Posted On:
                        18 MAY 2025 5:42PM by PIB Delhi
Introduction
In an age of multi-domain warfare, where threats evolve faster than borders shift,
India's national security architecture has demonstrated the strength of jointness and strategic foresight
.
Operation SINDOOR
, initiated on
May 7, 2025
, in the aftermath of the
Pahalgam terror attack
, which claimed the lives of 26 innocent civilians
showcased a calibrated,
tri-services response
that embodied precision, professionalism, and purpose.
Operation SINDOOR was conceived as a punitive and targeted campaign to
dismantle the terror infrastructure
across the
Line of Control
and deeper inside Pakistan.
Multi-agency intelligence
provided confirmation of
nine
major camps that were eventually targeted in the operation. India’s retaliatory action was based on
meticulous planning
and an
intelligence-led approach
, which ensured that the operations were conducted with
minimal collateral damage
. Operational ethics were central to the mission, and restraint was exercised to avoid civilian harm.
In the aftermath of Operation SINDOOR
, Pakistan initiated a series of
retaliatory drone and UCAV attacks
targeting key
Indian airbases
and
logistics infrastructure
. These attempts, however, were effectively neutralised by India’s
comprehensive and multilayered air defence architecture
. Central to this success was the
Integrated Command and Control Strategy (ICCS)
, which facilitated
real-time threat identification, assessment, and interception
across multiple domains.
In every single domain of Operation Sindoor there was operational
synergy
between the forces and fully supported by the Government, agencies and departments.
The operation unfolded across land, air, and sea—
a seamless demonstration of synergy

The Navy’s ability to establish uncontested control over the seas also validated its anti-missile and anti-aircraft defence capabilities in a complex threat environment.
During Operation Sindoor, the
Border Security Force (BSF)
also played a critical role in thwarting a
major infiltration attempt
along the International Border in the

district of Jammu and Kashmir. BSF troops noticed suspicious movement in the early hours and swiftly responded, leading to a heavy exchange of fire. In the ensuing encounter, the BSF
successfully neutralized
at least
two infiltrators and recovered arms, ammunition, and other war-like stores

Operation SINDOOR was thus not just a tactical success but a
strategic statement
. It demonstrated India’s capacity for
high-precision, coordinated military action across land, air, and sea.
The operation was made possible by years of investment in defence preparedness and the unwavering policy and budgetary support from the Government of India. The message was clear: when appeals to reason and diplomacy are met with continued aggression, a decisive response is both justified and necessary. In sum, Operation SINDOOR will be remembered as a
defining moment in India’s defence history—a symbol of military precision, inter-service cooperation, and national resolve.
It successfully eliminated terror threats, reaffirmed India’s regional dominance, and sent a strong message that cross-border terrorism would be met with a calibrated yet firm response.
Major Government-Led Coordination Efforts Among the Armed Forces
1. Creation of the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS)
On
24 December 2019
, the Union Cabinet approved the creation of the
Chief of Defence Staff (CDS)
, a four-star General who heads the
Department of Military Affairs (DMA)
and acts as the principal military adviser to the Defence Minister on tri-Service matters.
Key roles of the CDS include:
Overseeing the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Territorial Army.
Promoting jointness in procurement, training, staffing, and command restructuring.
Leading tri-service organizations, including cyber and space commands.
Advising the Nuclear Command Authority and participating in defence planning bodies.
Driving reforms to optimize resources, enhance combat capabilities, and reduce waste.
Implementing multi-year defence acquisition plans and prioritizing inter-Service needs.
The CDS strengthens unified leadership and fosters integration for a more coordinated and modern Indian military.
2. Integrated Theatre Commands
(ITCs)
To modernize the Armed Forces, efforts are underway to restructure forces through the establishment of
Integrated Theatre Commands (ITCs)
and
Integrated Battle Groups (IBGs)
. These reforms aim to optimize operational preparedness by unifying the Army, Navy, and Air Force capabilities based on geography and function. Studies at the Service Headquarters level are actively exploring Theatre Commands for
Land Borders, Maritime, and Joint/Integrated Air Defence
to enhance synergy and combat effectiveness. The Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Gen Anil Chauhan has emphasized that
jointness and integration
are essential prerequisites for ITCs, which will clearly separate operational roles from administrative Raise-Train-Sustain (RTS) functions, allowing commanders to focus on security and operations. ITCs represent the start of wider reforms toward
multi-domain operations
, integrating space and cyberspace with traditional domains, and advancing digitization and data-centric warfare.
3. Creation of the Department of Military Affairs (DMA)
Department of Military Affairs (DMA)
with
CDS
as
Secretary
was created in
2020
to facilitate optimal utilization of resources and
promote jointness
among the three Services. The subjects allocated to DMA include:
The
Armed Forces
of the Union, namely, Army, Navy and Air Force.
Integrated Headquarters of the Ministry of Defence
comprising of Army Headquarters, Naval Headquarters, Air Headquarters and Defence Staff Headquarters.
Works relating to Army, Navy and Air Force
.
Promoting jointness in procurement
, training and staffing for the Services through joint planning and integration of their requirements.
Facilitation of restructuring of Military Commands
for optimal utilisation of resources by bringing about jointness in operations, including through establishment of joint / theatre commands.
4. Inter-Services Organisations (Command, Control & Discipline) Act, 2023
The Inter-Services Organisations (Command, Control & Discipline) Act, 2023 promotes
jointness
in the Indian Armed Forces by
empowering commanders
of
tri-service formations with authority over personnel from all three Services.
This unifies the disciplinary chain, speeds up decision-making, and fosters operational and cultural integration. By streamlining command without affecting individual Service identities, the Act lays the legal foundation for future integrated theatre commands. Key implications of this Act are:
Unified command:
ISO commanders can discipline all personnel under one authority.
Faster processes:
Reduces delays from inter-Service coordination.
Joint culture:
Encourages cross-Service cohesion and shared responsibility.
Legal base for theatre commands:
Supports future integrated operations.
Service identity retained:
Each Service’s unique norms remain intact.
5. Joint Logistics Nodes (JLNs)
Three Joint Logistic Nodes (JLNs)
have been established and are operational since
2021
at
Mumbai
,
Guwahati
and
Port Blair
for
Logistics Integration
between the
three services
. These JLNs will provide
integrated logistics cover
to the Armed Forces for their small arms ammunition, rations, fuel, general stores, civil hired transport, aviation clothing, spares and also engineering support in an effort to synergize their operational efforts. This initiative would accrue advantages in terms of
saving of manpower, economize utilisation of resources, besides financial savings.

strategic
,
exclusive
,
secure
and
state-of-the-art communication network
. Implementation of DCN is a proof of strength of the Indian industry and has reaffirmed the emphasis of the Government on
Make in India
program. The DCN is a major step towards ensuring
Network Centricity
across the three Services
, Integrated Defence Staff and Strategic Forces Command. The network provides converged voice, data and video services to the three Services based on secured system with adequate redundancy.
Integrated Air Command and Control System (IACCS):

transforming the Armed Forces into a technologically-advanced combat-ready force capable of multi-domain integrated operations
. The broad areas identified for focussed intervention in 2025 include:
Reforms should aim to further
bolster Jointness & Integration initiatives
and facilitate establishment of the
Integrated Theatre Commands
.
Develop a shared understanding of operational requirements and joint operational capabilities through
inter-service cooperation & training

Conclusion
India’s ability to project strength across
land, sea, and air
is no longer theoretical—it is structured, synchronized, and deeply integrated. The nation’s
tri-services architecture
now operates as a cohesive force. As modern threats blur traditional boundaries, this integrated posture ensures that whether confronting aggression on the high Himalayas, securing maritime frontiers, or neutralizing aerial intrusions, India stands
ready, resilient, and united
. The future of national security lies in jointness—and India is already charting that future with purpose and resolve.
